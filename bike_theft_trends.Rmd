- bike purchase
- risk assessment
- if and how they changed over time
- bike features and risk factors associated with bike theft
story
- meaningful title
- introduction: goal
- clear sections with meaningful section headers
- for each visualization: what question the visualization addresses
  - what the reader should see that is useful/interesting for understanding the story
  - how its analysis leads to new question and the visualization that follows
- summarize main finding and actionable insights

```{r}
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(latticeExtra)
data <- read.csv("bicycle-thefts-2014-2019.csv")
```
- trends over months and years
- costs over time

```{r}
data$Cost_of_Bike[is.na(data$Cost_of_Bike)] <- 0
data_month <- data %>%
  group_by(Occurrence_Year, Occurrence_Month) %>%
  summarise(frequency=n(), cost=sum(Cost_of_Bike))
data_month$Occurrence_Date <- zoo::as.yearmon(paste(data_month$Occurrence_Year, data_month$Occurrence_Month), "%Y %m")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=data_month) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=Occurrence_Date, y=frequency)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=Occurrence_Date, y=frequency))
```
```{r}
data_year <- data_month %>%
  group_by(Occurrence_Year) %>%
  summarise(frequency=sum(frequency),
            cost=sum(cost))

```
- primary offense over time
- make, speed, color
- location of theft
- location of most thefts
- time of day
```{r}
data_offense <- data %>%
  filter(str_detect(Primary_Offence, "THEFT") | str_detect(Primary_Offence, "B&E")) %>%

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
